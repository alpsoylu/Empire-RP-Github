spain.6.t:0 "Maria Anna and Cardinal Portocarrero Compete for the King's Ear"
spain.6.d:0 "With the health of Charles II deteriorating, the actual power of the monarch came into the hands of powerful advisors in the court. The most influential of these people were Maria Anna, Charles' Wife, and cardinal Portocarrero, an ambitious clergyman.\n \nThe two regularly clash over Charles' will. Maria Anna is in favor of an Austrian succesor to the throne, whilst Portocarrero is strongly pro-Bourbon.\n \nWith Charles' health worsening, one of these advisors must be appointed as designated regent. Not an easy choice, as it may have a deep impact on future developments in Europe."
spain.6.a:0 "Stay loyal to Maria Anna"
spain.6.b:0 "Portocarrero has superiour knowledge of statesmanship!"
spain.7.t:0 "The Pope grants his blessing!"

spain.9.t:0 "Habsburg faction dominates the Spanish court"
spain.9.d.a:0 "It has come to our attention that the pro-Habsburg faction has come to dominate our court. If the current trends remain, we can expect our nation to remain a Habsburg monarchy, after the passing of Carlos II whose health is more fragile than ever."
spain.9.d.b:0 "Bad news! Our spies in Madrid report how the Habsburg faction supporting Charles of Austria as the heir of Carlos II is dominating the court. If nothing is done about this situation, we might soon find yet another Habsburg on the Spanish throne!"
spain.10.t:0 "Bourbon faction dominates the Spanish court"
spain.10.d.a:0 "It has come to our attention that the pro-Bourbon faction has come to dominate our court. The more friendly approach to France by the court, might mean our country will soon be lead by a Bourbon, ending two centuries of Habsburg reign."
spain.10.d.b:0 "Bad news! Our spies in Madrid report how the Bourbon faction supporting Philip of Anjou as the heir of Carlos II is dominating the court. If nothing is done about this situation, we might soon find yet another Habsburg on the Spanish throne!"

spain.14.d:0 "One of our treasure fleets which had departed in Havana several weeks ago, is still nowhere to be seen. It would appear, that the fleet carrying the cargo, was somehow lost at sea, or worse, it was captured by pirates. Truth is, we shall never know!"
spain.15.t:0 "Carlos II falls ill"
spain.15.d:0 "The king has fallen terribly ill. While king Carlos has always had a fragile health to begin with, it is now appearant that his health is beginning to fail completely. With a succession crisis looming, the country is now waiting anxiously for Carlos to draw his final breath. "

spain.17.t:0 "Estates of Aragon remain divided"

The crown of Aragon is comprised of various duchies, namely Majorca, Valencia, Aragon, Catalonia, Sicily, Sardinia, and Naples.
